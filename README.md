# Emotion_Recognition_fromSpeech
This project develops a deep learning-based speech emotion recognition system using the RAVDESS dataset. MFCC features were extracted with Librosa, and a neural network was trained to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, and neutral. Performance was evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
